# PyLearn
My first attempt at learning Python/Flask

This is a small application created using Python, Flask and SQLite.

User need to login using the credentials given below. For now it is single user app.
User Name: admin 
Password: default

After login fill out a small questionnaire. 
At the end it shows the report and sends out an email with PDF version of the report.

Some of the functionalities covered are:

Using SQLite (Create database, table, save and query data)
Perform AJAX request and return JSON as response
Generating PDF
Sending email with attachment
Some validations
